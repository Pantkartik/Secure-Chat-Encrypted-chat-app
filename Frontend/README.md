Cypher Chat (P.B.L CRYPTOGRAPHY)
=========================
A cypher and anonymous chat application using QR code scanning for easy access.

# Description
Cypher Chat is a secure and anonymous chat application that allows users to communicate without the need for signing up or logging in. Users can simply scan a QR code to join a chat room and start messaging. The application uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that messages are secure and private. Additionally, messages can be set to self-destruct after a certain period, enhancing confidentiality.

# Features
1. QR code-based access: Users can join chat rooms by scanning a QR code.
2. End-to-end encryption: All messages are encrypted to ensure privacy.
3. Self-destructing messages: Users can set messages to delete automatically after a specified time
4. Anonymous chat: No personal information is required to use the app.
